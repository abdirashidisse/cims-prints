/* Two macros that make it easier to produce main program source codes
that write usage messages in case of incorrect numbers of arguments.
CAUTION: For these macros to work correctly, the "argument count" and
"argument vector" parameters of main() must be called argc and argv
(their usual names). */


/*******************************************************************/

/* A macro for use with a command that has a fixed number of
arguments.  Example of how to use it: if correct usage of the command
foobar is "foobar foo bar", then let the first line of the main
program source code be a call of the Usage macro with a string
showing the usage, but omitting the comand name:
  Usage("foo bar");
If the arg count is not one more than the number of words in the
provided string, then the result is the writing of a usage message to
stderr (for this example, "ERROR: Usage: foobar foo bar") and an
exit(1). */

/* A macro for use with a command that has an unfixed number of
arguments.  To use it, check whether argc indicates that the number
of args cannot be right, and if so call the usage macro with a
string showing the usage, but omitting the command name.  For example,
if the correct usage of the command barfoo is
"barfoo bar[bar..] foo[foo..]", then begin the main program source
code with:
  if(!(argc >= 3 && (argc & 1)))
    usage("bar[bar]... foo[foo]...");
If argc indicates incorrect usage, the usage macro will be called and
the result will be the writing of a usage message to stderr (for this
example, "ERROR: Usage: barfoo bar[bar]... foo[foo]...") and an
exit(1). */
